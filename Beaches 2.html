	<h2><font face="Cosmic sans MS" color="#FA1D69"><b>West Coast</b></font></h2>

	<p>Sri Lanka’s west coast shows the island at its most developed, its most Westernized, and its most tourist-oriented. A string of fine beaches, backed by hundreds of hotels and guesthouses, peppers the coast from Negombo in the north to Hikkaduwa in the south. Despite increasing development in other parts of the island, the large hotels in Negombo, Kalutara, Beruwala and Bentota – all within easy reach of the capital, Colombo – continue to serve as the hub of the island’s substantial package-tourist industry. These resorts offer two-week trips to primarily European visitors, particularly during winter in the northern hemisphere.</p>

	<h2><b><font face="Cosmic sans MS" color="#FA1D69">South Coast</b></font></h2>

	<p>The south coast is one of Sri Lanka’s most rewarding areas to visit. Representing the island in microcosm, the region offers gorgeous beaches, colonial towns, and superb wildlife parks, as well as a host of Buddhist shrines and temples. In addition, this coastline is home to a selection of some of the island’s most alluring places to stay, from luxurious beach hotels to atmospheric colonial-era villas. </p>

	<p>Active travelers can find a never-ending range of things to do and see here. However, despite gradual ongoing development around the coast, much of the region’s charm lies in its somnolent and quintessentially rural atmosphere. Countless sleepy villages nestle in the shade of toppling palm trees, and the pace of life is unashamedly slow-moving. For proximity to more action, look for resorts near Galle, a colonial town on the southern coast.</p>

	<h2><b><font face="Cosmic sans MS" color="#FA1D69">East Coast</b></font></h2>

	<p>Sri Lanka’s east coast is unquestionably beautiful, but was off the tourist trail for many years due to the long-raging civil war, compounded by the damage wrought by the 2004 tsunami. However, in the years following the end of the civil war in 2009, there has been slow and steady reconstruction and the region now looks to the future with renewed confidence. Its major towns – Trincomalee and Batticaloa – are bustling with life and commercial activity, while ongoing development is starting to unlock the huge potential of the superb coastline – albeit at the inevitable cost of changing its formerly remote and magically unspoiled character.</p>

		<font face="Bedrock"  color="#4727D9" size="10"><div align="middle">HIRIKETIYA BEACH</font><br><br>

			<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">On the south coast, the area around Dikwella is gradually becoming more popular with travelers looking to escape the increasing development further to the west. A string of relatively unspoiled beaches dot the coast here, most notably the stunning little horseshoe bay at Hiriketiya, which is backed by a small selection of great places to stay.</font></p>

			<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Located on the outskirts of Dikwella, Hiriketiya Beach is protected by a lovely little cove. Consequently, it is a great place to go swimming and snorkeling, as the waters are so tranquil.The scenery is breathtaking, as trees cluster around its golden sands. Hidden away along the coastline are a plethora of hotels and resorts for visitors to choose from, although the area still feels very undeveloped in comparison with some of Sri Lanka’s other beaches.Ideal for people looking for a secluded getaway, Hiriketiya Beach’s proximity to some other delightful beaches means that you can explore all along the coast while using the market town of Dikwella as a base.</font></p>

			<br><br><br>
	<font face="Bedrock"  color="#4727D9" size="10"><div align="middle">BENTOTA BEACH</font><br><br>

			<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">One of the finest stretches of sand on the west coast, this beach runs south from magnificent Bentota lagoon and is lined with a string of alluring hotels. The southern end of the beach is home to some of the most appealing upmarket accommodation along this coastline, with a number of chic boutique hotels nestled amongst the palm trees. Bentota is also Sri Lanka's water sports hub. Behind the beach, the calm waters of the lagoon are perfect for kayaking and jet-skiing, while boat trips up the river to explore the mangroves and tangled waterways are easy to arrange.</font></p>

			<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Lying halfway between major destinations such as Colombo and Galle, adding a stop off at Bentota as part of Insight Guides' Sri Lanka Family Adventure trip makes perfect sense. </font></p>

			<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Bentota, the ultimate beach destination in Sri Lanka, offers a wide variety of engaging activities - be it gazing at the crystal clear waters or participating in water sports like snorkelling, windsurfing, water skiing, diving and swimming, etc. or lounging at the famous resort by the beach or visiting turtle hatcheries. The beaches in Bentota are the ideal location to enjoy these activities.</font></p>

	<font face="Bedrock"  color="#4727D9" size="10"><div align="middle">ARUGAM BAY</font><br><br>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">If you’re into surfing, there is no place better to visit in Sri Lanka than Arugam Bay. Large waves continually crash along the beautiful palm tree-lined beaches that stretch along most of the surrounding coastline.Although Arugam Bay is an increasingly popular tourist destination, it is still delightfully undeveloped, so you won’t find many large hotels or resorts. This is in part what makes it so appealing; the local charm still shines through in its little cafes, restaurants, and cabanas.>As well as enjoying the beautiful beaches, there are loads of activities to choose from here. Whether it’s taking a tour of the scenic Pottuvil Lagoon, basking in the sunset at Elephant Rock or going on safari and seeing actual elephants at Yala National Park, Arugam Bay has it all.</font></p>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Towards the southern end of the east coast, the village of Arugam Bay is a popular destination with independent travelers drawn by the charms of its beautiful, palm-fringed beach. Surfers originally put the village on the map by visiting to ride what are widely thought to be some of the best waves in Sri Lanka. The beach continues to attract plenty of surfers, but its laid-back vibe and offbeat charm provide wide-ranging appeal. </font></p>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">The local community have strongly and successfully resisted the development of major hotels. Plenty of casual lodgings are available in quirky village guesthouses and relaxed beachfront bungalows and cabanas. Tours of nearby Pottuvil Lagoon are easily arranged, as well as motor-boat trips out to sea in search of dolphins. </font></p>

	<font face="Bedrock"  color="#4727D9" size="10"><div align="middle">MIRISSA BEACH</font><br><br>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">On the south coast, the fine sands of Mirissa Beach are backed by palm trees, while its clear waters and lively waves make it ideal for both swimming and surfing. A cluster of hotels and guesthouses offer a variety of accommodation choices nearby. Development here has been driven by Mirissa’s emergence as the whale-watching capital of Sri Lanka. Numerous whales can frequently be spotted reasonably close to the shoreline and multiple tour operators based in the village offer boat trips to see them during the season, which runs from December to April.</font></p>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Mirissa is a gem of the south coast of Sri Lanka. It's located in a small village between Galle and Matara. 600 meters of shoreline, shaped like a crescent and covered in light pinkish sand, round the ocean, where surfers from all over the world come to</font></p>

	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Mirissa is a beach located close to the southern tip of Sri Lanka, approximately 200 km (120 mi) from the equator,and 4 km (2.5 mi) southeast of Weligama, a town on the south coast of Sri Lanka.It is crescent-shaped and secluded</font></p>

	<br><br><br>

 	<font face="Bedrock"  color="#4727D9" size="10"><div align="middle">UPPUVELI BEACH</font><br><br>

 	<p><font face="times new roman" size="4">Just north of Trincomalee on the east coast, the sleepy village of Uppuveli is a great option if you want a beautiful beach well off the beaten track. Proximity to the former civil war zone means that this seemingly endless swathe of soft white sand lining the coast remains remarkably unspoiled. Development is happening gradually and there is now a reasonable selection of casual hotels and guesthouses. The area is also developing a reputation as a center for whale-watching and diving.</font></p>
