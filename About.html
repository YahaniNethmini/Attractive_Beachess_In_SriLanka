A number of small food shacks and restaurants line the beach, catering to the necessary requirements of its visitors. Hammocks and beachside chairs that line the place allows Koggala’s guests to simply lounge under the open sun and enjoy the rolling blue waters of the Indian Ocean. The scenic beach is an ideal locale to observe the stilt fisherman at work. These traditional fishermen, indeginous to the country, practice their art in a unique method and style, and are a sight to behold if never seen before.</em></p>
